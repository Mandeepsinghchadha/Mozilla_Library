The current download manager that is used by the Firefox Lite application lacks several
features. It could be severely improved with the ability to pause / resume / cancel downloads
along with additional features such as scheduling the downloads according to
userâ€™s convenience . This could help us improve the overall user experience and enable a more
rich use of the download manager.
